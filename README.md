Short flight delay analysis + viz in D3

Line chart is sub optimal without an axis or popup on mouse-over to show what it is, by default the viz does not have this feature, so just the title will have to do.

Creating the data input for the D3 charts is not very nice (r file for that), it looks like it will end up rather clumsy if we want to make this dynamic, but I'm probably missing something here.
